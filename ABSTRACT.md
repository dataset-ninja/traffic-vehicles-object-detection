The **Traffic Vehicles Object Detection** dataset is a valuable resource containing 1,201 images capturing the dynamic world of traffic, featuring 11,134 meticulously labeled objects. These objects are classified into seven distinct categories, including common vehicles like *car*, *two_wheeler*, as well as *blur_number_plate*, and other essential elements such as *auto*, *number_plate*, *bus*, and *truck*. The dataset's origins lie in the collection of training images from traffic scenes and CCTV footage, followed by precise object annotation and labeling, making it an ideal tool for object detection tasks in the realm of transportation and surveillance.

The dataset contains labeled images of transport vehicles and number plates using LabelImg in YOLOv5 format.

Author first collected some 1000 training images of traffic, vehicles and number plates, and CCTV footage videos. Then he extracted frames from videos using OpenCV. Drew a box around each object that he want the detector to see and label each box with the object class that he would like the detector to predict. Data was collected from open-source websites.
